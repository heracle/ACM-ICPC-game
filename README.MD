Catch and solve as many tractors as you can!

You can select a programmer and move him with WASD

Each programmer has a list of tasks to solve (displayed in the special region for information about selected programmer).	He is thinking just at his first problem in the list (this means that the requirement for solving that task will decrease with the programmer's skills each second).

When you are clicking on a problem in the list, there could be two situations:	 
a)if the task is already solved (so, it has a strange green border), the problem will be removed from the list and the total score incremented	 
b)if the task is is not completely solved, the problem will be moved to the top of the list (that single position where the programmer is thinking)

Bonus
You can move one tractor from one programmer to another one by drag and drop from the sender list to the receiver programmer icon on map
